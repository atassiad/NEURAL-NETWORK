# NEURAL-NETWORK
This repository contains the implementation of a neural network from scratch in Python (using NumPy). The project was developed to gain a deeper understanding of the core concepts of machine learning and deep learning. In the function testing folder there are implementations of different features (some commented out) I used along the way to improve my understanding.

Functions Implemented:
- Softmax Activation w/ exponentiation, Rectified Linear activation function, Categorical Cross Entropy for loss, backward pass (gradient descent), and an optimizer function (in-progress).

Note*: This project was created w/ guidance from Neural Network From Scratch (NNFS) YouTube series by SentDex/Harrison Kinsley and the NNFS book by Harrison Kinsley
